                        My name is Michael Lang and I currently reside in Danbury, CT with my wife and two dogs. I have a Bachelors degree in Finance from Quinnipiac University, and my Masters in Information Systems from Marist College with a dual concentration in Systems Management and Data Analytics. While studying at Quinnipiac University, I played two years on the men’s baseball team. In my spare time I enjoy golfing, watching movies, and playing with my dog. <br>
                        My most recent professional experience is at Rockit Solutions where I manage a daily data load process where bank data is normalized and loaded into Rockit’s proprietary system. I also spend a large amount of time creating automation solutions through the use of: Microsoft Access, SQL, PowerShell, and Batch that support mine and other departments as well as clients.
